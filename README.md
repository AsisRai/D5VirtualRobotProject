Virtual Robot Development

Our program is written in Python.

---- Our idea ----

1.	First screen would stay the same as before. This will be the first screen when the program starts and two buttons would be added to it, ‘Start’ button and ‘Quit’ button. Start button will start the game and take the user to the next screen and Quit game button will close the code and exit the program. Furthermore, instructions will be added to the screen for the user considering one of the principle from 106CR, Designing for usability.

2.	There will be the second screen the user will see after the ‘Start’ button is pressed. On the right hand side of the screen the user will see a text box and a question. The question will say ‘Enter colour Red for BMW, colour Blue for Vauxhall, colour Green for Land Rover and colour pink for Lexus. The user will enter the input the colour type in the text box. If the user has entered anything other than the colours allowed, then they will see error message giving the user instruction again to what the user can input and the user may try again.

3.	There will be the third screen the user will see and only allowed if the user has inputted the correct colour type from previous screen. In this screen the user will see be able to see the map clearly on the screen and in the right hand side of the screen the user will be able to input the co-ordinates to which side of the map the user wants the robot to search from for the car models. There will be a clear instruction in the right hand side of the screen telling the user what to do in this screen. The screen will move on to the next screen after the user has inputted the co-ordinates in this screen.

4.	There will be the forth screen and the user will only be able to move to this screen after the user has inputted the co-ordinates in the previous screen, instructing the robot where to start searching from. This screen will follow the same procedure as the last one, however in this screen the user will be asked to input how many car models the user wants the user to search for and the user has to input the number of car models accordingly. E.g. 1

5.	There will be the fifth screen and in this screen the user will be able to input the number of minutes(time) the user would like the robot to search for the car models. After the user has inputting the input the time, all the input has been recorded by the robot and now the robot will start searching for the car models by using the values provided by the user and display the robot’s movement in left side of the map. After it has finished searching, the robot will have displayed the results found in the right side of the map with the results and the time it took for the robot to find the results, the results will be displayed in ascending order.
